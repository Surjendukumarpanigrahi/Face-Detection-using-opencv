# Face-Detection-using-opencv
Hello  guys,This is the most simple face detection code you ever gonna see.
As we all know it takes a lot time to process different types of images for facial Detection
So here I used a xml file which contains all the peviously processed data by opencv years ago which saves you guys a lot of time cuz you guys dont have to process the face images again and again every time you run.
